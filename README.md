## Welcome! üëã

I've been a software enthusiast since 2012. Currently, I work at [RELEX Solutions](https://www.relexsolutions.com/) as a Senior Engineering Manager, based in Helsinki, Finland.

### üöÄ Featured Projects
- [**poor-man-s-cache**](https://github.com/MisterVVP/poor-man-s-cache)  
  A **high-performance coroutine-based TCP cache server in C++**, inspired by Redis.  
  It started as a pet project but has grown into a stable cache system with a custom key-value store, epoll-based networking, memory pool optimizations, and compression logic.  
  My current goal is to push its performance to **10M and then 100M requests per second**.

- [**prism-plan**](https://github.com/MisterVVP/prism-plan)  
  A simple **time and task management** application, built with React and Vite. (mobile client is coming)  
  It supports **drag-and-drop scheduling**, and has a clean productivity-focused UI. It is a pet project focused on microservice design and scalability, implemented on Microsoft Azure cloud stack.
